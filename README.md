Ominos is a shooter where you, the player, is a tetromino (Tetris piece). Shoots differently based on shape, color, and orientation. 

play @ https://TetraShmup.amuseum.repl.co

Your color is:  
= red = round pellets  
= blue = laser beams  
= yellow = exploding missiles  
= magenta = energy field  
= green = bouncy balls  
= white = falling pieces  
= blue = seeker arrows  
= black = sticky fidgets  
= silver = satellite yoyos  

Eat the PLUS-shaped '+' spinning ominos on the screen to change shape (randomly) and color (matches PLUS omino). They will also heal your shield, increase your movement speed, and gain you 100 points.

Every 1,000 points will level up your ship and offense. Increases your firing rate, and improves attacks significantly. However, also makes enemies more dangerous.

Use keyboard to move and turn. Your ship will autofire.
